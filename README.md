# AEM Valtech_ Training

In this exercise I have created a custom carousel component. This component basic have a Title and a carousel of images and descriptions. When added more then 3 images, it shows up two buttons, one to go to the next image, and one to go back. In this component, the author is able to add new images, chose if he wants to hide any of the images without deleting it from the database, also it is possible to add or not a description and a link for the image. Besides, when the description is larger then two lines, it gets cutted with a '...' simbol.
